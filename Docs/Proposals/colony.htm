Project: Introduction of std::colony to the standard library<br>
Reply-to: Matthew Bentley &lt;mattreecebentley@gmail.com&gt;<br>


<h1>Introduction of std::colony to the standard library</h1>

<h2>I. Introduction</h2>

<p>A colony is a C++ template-based unordered data container which provides
better performance than any std:: library container when:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Insertions and erasures to the container are occuring frequently in
    realtime ie. in performance-critical code, <i><b>and/or</b></i> </li>
  <li>Pointers to non-erased container elements must not be invalidated by
    insertion or erasure.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's predominant field of usage is game development, but subsequent reports
from high-performance computing and other domains have suggested it may be more
generically useful. While the benchmarks referenced in the appendix are a
better method for understanding the performance characteristics, the general
speed characteristics are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Insertion</i>: better than any std:: library container except some
    implementations of deque.</li>
  <li><i>Erasure</i>: better or equal to any std:: library container.</li>
  <li><i>Iteration</i>: better than any std:: library container where pointer
    validity is important. Where pointer validity is unimportant, better than
    any std:: library container except deque and vector.</li>
</ul>

<p>As explored in the benchmarks there are some vector/deque
modifications/workarounds which can outperform during iteration while
maintaining pointer validity, but at a cost to usability and memory use.
Furthermore, when the ratio of insertions/erasures to iterations is greater
than 1% insertions/erasures per 3600 full iterations over data, Colony tends to
outperform these workarounds. Colony's other other advantages are freeing and
recycling unused memory on-the-fly, the guaranteed stability of
pointers/references to non-erased elements regardless of insertion and erasure
(which makes programming with containers of interrelated data structures faster
and much simpler). Iterators which do not point to end() or erased elements are
also guaranteed to remain stable.</p>

<p>A colony is it's own abstract data type. It is most similar to a "bag",
"bucket-array" or "multiset" ADT, but without key values. As it was initially
developed predominantly for game development, colony favours small and large
struct/class performance over scalar-type performance.</p>

<h2>II. Motivation and Scope</h2>

<p>When working on video game engines we are predominantly dealing with
collections of data where:<br>
(<i>Note: These requirements match other areas of software development as well,
but to simplify discussion I will focus on video game development</i>)</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Elements within data collections refer to elements within other data
    collections (through a variety of methods - indices, pointers, etc). An
    example is a game entity referring to both a texture object and collision
    blocks, as well as sound data. These references must stay valid throughout
    the course of the game/level. For this reason, any container (or use of a
    container) which causes pointer or index invalidation can create
    difficulties or necessitate workarounds.</li>
  <li>Order is unimportant for the most part. The majority of data collections
    are simply iterated over, transformed, referred to and utilized with no
    regard to order.</li>
  <li>Storage of small-to-medium-sized classes and structs is the norm. Work
    with collections of small scalar types like int, double is far less common.
    Sometimes data can be stored in a SoA (Struct of Arrays) configuration, but
    these cases are somewhat less common.</li>
  <li>Erasing or otherwise removing or deactivating objects occurs frequently
    in-game and in realtime (though often erasures will be implemented to occur
    at the end of a frame due to multithreading concerns). An example could be
    destroying a wall, or a game enemy. For this reason methods of erasure
    which create strong performance penalties are avoided.</li>
  <li>Creating new objects and adding them into the gameworld on-the-fly is
    also common - for example, a tree which drops leaves every so often, or a
    quadtree.</li>
  <li>We don't always know in advance how many elements there will be in a
    container at the beginning of development, or even at the beginning of a
    level during playback - an example of this being a MMORPG (massively
    multiplayer online role-playing game). In a MMORPG the number of game
    entities fluctuates based on how many players are playing, though there may
    be maximum capacity limits. Genericized game engines in particular have to
    adapt to considerably different user requirements and scopes. For this
    reason extensible containers which can expand and contract in realtime are
    usually necessary.</li>
  <li>Depending on the complexity and scope of any given game, we can be
    dealing with anywhere between 10 and 100000 objects in a given area. We are
    not typically dealing with the types of capacities necessitated by
    large-scale mathematical or statistical applications.</li>
  <li>For performance reasons, memory storage which is more-or-less contiguous
    is preferred. Lists, vectors of pointers to dynamically-allocated objects,
    and maps as implemented in the standard library are unusable.</li>
  <li>Memory wastage is avoided, and in particular, any container which
    allocates upon initialisation tends to be avoided as this can incur
    purposeless memory and performance costs.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>std::vector in it's default state does not meet these requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Poor erasure performance for large amounts of data (even with
remove_if duration is highly variable)</li>

<li>Poor insertion (non-fll) performance due to reallocation
</li>
<li>Insert invalidates pointers/iterators to all elements
</li>
<li>Erase invalidates pointers/iterators/indexes to all elements
afer the erased element
</li>
<li>Requires single contiguous memory block (typically larger
than cache lines) which increases chance of allocation failures
for large amounts of data on insert</li>
</ol>

<p>To meet these requirements, game developers tend to either (a) develop their
own custom containers for given scenario or (b) develop workarounds for the
failings of vector. These workarounds are many and varied, but the most common
are probably:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using a boolean flag (or similar) to indicate the inactivity of an object
    (as opposed to actually erasing from the vector). When erasing, one simply
    adjusts the boolean flag, and when iterating, items with the adjusted
    boolean flag are skipped. External elements refer to elements within the
    container via indexes rather than pointers (which can be invalidated upon
    insertion).
    <p>Advantages: Fast erasure.</p>
    <p>Disadvantages: Slow to iterate due to branching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Utilizing a vector of data with a secondary vector of indexes. When
    erasing, the erasure occurs in the vector of indexes, not the vector of
    data, and when iterating, one iterates over the vector of indexes, then
    accessing the data from the vector of data via the index.
    <p>Advantages: Faster iteration.</p>
    <p>Disadvantages: Erasure still incurs some reallocation cost, can increase
    jitter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Combining a swap-and-pop mechanism with some form of dereferenced lookup
    system to enable contiguous element iteration (known as a 'packed array',
    or various other names). This technique allows for standard vector
    iteration speed, but decreases lookup and referential performance. Erasure
    speed is also fast unless elements are large and/or non-trivially
  swappable.</li>
</ol>
<br>


<p>All three techniques have the disadvantage of slow singular insertions, and
the first two will also continually expand memory usage when erasing and
inserting over periods of time. The third deals better with this scenario as it
swaps from the back rather than leaving gaps in the elements vector, however will suffer in performance if elements within the container are heavily referred to by external objects/elements, or if the elements are large and swap/copy is non-trivial.</p>

<p>Colony is an attempt to bring a more generic solution to this domain. It has
the advantage of good iteration speed while maintaining a similar erasure speed
to the boolean technique described above, and without causing pointer
invalidation (to non-erased elements) during erasure or insertion. It's insertion speed is
much faster than a vector's and similar to a good deque implementation's. Memory from erased elements is either reused by
subsequent insertions or released to the OS on-the-fly. It achieves these ends
by via a number of new approaches: a <a
href="http://www.plflib.org/the_jump_counting_skipfield_pattern.pdf">jump-counting
skipfield</a> (instead of a boolean field), a <a
href="chained_group_allocation_pattern.htm">linked chain</a> of
increasingly-large memory blocks (instead of a singular memory block or vector
of blocks), and an internal high-performance stack structure to enable erased memory location re-use.</p>


<h2>III. Impact On the Standard</h2>

<p>No changes are necessary to the standard, asides from the introduction of the colony container. The reference implementation of colony is available <a href="http://www.plflib.org/colony.htm#download">here</a> as
plf::colony.</p>

<h2>IV. Design Decisions</h2>

<p>There are three necessary aspects to colony which make it function as it
does, and which define any implementation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A multiple-memory-block based allocation pattern which allows for the
    fast removal of memory blocks when they become empty of elements,
    regardless of their location.</li>
  <li>A skipfield to indicate erasures instead of reallocating elements, the
    iteration of which should typically not necessitate the use of branching
    code.</li>
  <li>A mechanism for reusing erased element locations upon subsequent insertions.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the case of the reference implementation I utilized a doubly-linked
intrusive list of 'group' structs containing (a) memory blocks, (b) memory
block metadata and (c) skipfields. The linked-list pattern removes the
possibility of non-O(1) operations when freeing empty memory blocks from the
colony structure, compared to a vector of pointers to memory
blocks. A vector of pointers to memory blocks may however enable faster insertions while increasing implementation complexity. Comparitive benchmarks would be necessary to establish overall optimal approach.</p>

<p>For the skipfield a boolean skipfield cannot be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>++ iteration is O(random), iterators require O(1) operations
</li>
<li>Any boolean skipfeld creates branching code in the iterator
</li>
<li>Dependent on CPU branch prediction for performance
</li>
<li>Iterator code complexity
</li>
<li>Waste of 7 bits (and 254 states) per element if aiming for speed
(byte-level addressing- bool or char) rather than storage size
(bitfeld - slower)</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons the reference implementation instead utilizes the <a
href="http://www.plflib.org/the_jump_counting_skipfield_pattern.pdf">jump-counting
skipfield pattern</a> which allows for O(1) time
complexity iterator operations and performs better due to a lack of branching.</p>

<p>For the erased location re-use mechanism, the reference implementation uses a stripped-down custom internal stack class based on <a
href="http://www.plflib.org/stack.htm">plf::stack</a> (plf::stack outperforms other std:: containers in a stack context across compilers).
<h5>Time to push all elements + read-and-pop all elements, plf::stack vs std::stack (std::deque) vs std::vector:</h5>

<h2>V. Technical Specifications</h2>

<p>The key features of a colony are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unordered non-associative data container</li>
  <li>Never invalidates pointers to non-erased elements</li>
  <li>Reuses memory from erased elements or frees to OS</li>
  <li>Performance is oriented towards small-large struct/class storage rather
    than scalar storage</li>
  <li>In the context of general game data (as described), should be faster than
    any unmodified standard library container</li>
	<li>Iterators to non-erased elements guaranteed to stay valid unless iterator == end()</li>
</ul>

<p>The full list of abstract requirements to support these features are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uses multiple memory-blocks – prevents element reallocation on insertion
    Blocks are freed to OS once empty</li>
  <li>Blocks must be removable with low performance cost and without pointers
    to elements being invalidated</li>
  <li>Has mechanism for reusing erased element locations upon insertion</li>
  <li>Erased elements recorded in a skipfield, skipped over during iteration -
    prevents element reallocation on erasure</li>
  <li>Skipfield design must allow for O(1) ++ and -- iteration</li>
</ul>

<p>Iterators are bidirectional but additionally support >, <, >= and <= operators for convenience.</p>

<p>ADL overloads for the standard library functions advance(), next(), prev() and distance() are available. These are significantly faster in most cases for colony than the equivalent standard functions.</p>
